# FILE NAMING AND CHARACTER ENCODING POLICY

## STRICT ASCII-ONLY REQUIREMENT

**MANDATORY**: All file names, directory names, and file paths MUST contain ONLY ASCII characters (codes 0-127).

### PROHIBITED CHARACTERS:
- Non-ASCII characters (Unicode > U+007F)
- Foreign language characters (Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Cyrillic, etc.)
- Special Unicode symbols (emojis, mathematical symbols, etc.)
- Accented characters (é, ñ, ü, etc.) - use base ASCII equivalents instead

### ACCEPTABLE CHARACTERS:
- Basic Latin letters: A-Z, a-z
- Digits: 0-9
- Standard punctuation: . _ - ( ) [ ] { } 
- Space character (use judiciously)

### REMEDIATION:
If non-ASCII characters are detected:
1. Immediately rename the file using ASCII equivalents
2. Update all references to the file in code and documentation
3. Verify the change doesn't break any functionality

### EXAMPLES:
❌ **Invalid**: `Streaming极rvice.kt` (contains Chinese character)
✅ **Valid**: `StreamingService.kt` (ASCII-only)

❌ **Invalid**: `café.txt` (contains accented character)
✅ **Valid**: `cafe.txt` (ASCII equivalent)
